# Trends Command

Analyze pattern trends and generate actionable insights.

## Usage

```
/platform-trends                       Show current trend summary
/platform-trends --window <days>       Use different analysis window (default: 30)
/platform-trends --compare             Compare current window to previous
/platform-trends --alerts              Show only actionable alerts
/platform-trends --service <name>      Show trends for specific service
```

## Workflow

### `/platform-trends` (default)

1. Read `.opencode/patterns/platform-trends.json`
2. Display summary of pattern trends
3. Highlight alerts and recommendations

**Output format:**

```

=== ALERTS ===

🔴 HIGH PRIORITY:

  unvalidated-input [security] [blocking]
  ├─ Trend: +150% (2 → 5 occurrences)
  ├─ Affected: api-dev in compute-api, network-api
  └─ Action: Consider team training on input validation patterns

  missing-status-condition [correctness] [blocking]
  ├─ Trend: +100% (3 → 6 occurrences)
  ├─ Affected: api-dev across all services
  └─ Action: Review status condition checklist in api-dev runbook

🟡 WATCH:

  storage-init-race [correctness] [warning]
  ├─ Trend: new (0 → 3 occurrences)
  ├─ Affected: api-dev in compute-api
  └─ Action: Monitor; may indicate new pattern emerging

=== IMPROVEMENTS ===

✅ hardcoded-value
   ├─ Trend: -60% (5 → 2 occurrences)
   └─ Team is improving on avoiding hardcoded values

✅ import-ordering
   ├─ Trend: resolved (3 → 0 occurrences)
   └─ Convention now consistently followed

=== CROSS-SERVICE INSIGHTS ===

Services with most findings:
  1. compute-api:  15 findings (8 patterns)
  2. network-api:  10 findings (6 patterns)
  3. storage-api:   5 findings (4 patterns)

Pattern correlation:
  - missing-status-condition appears across ALL services
  - storage-init-race concentrated in compute-api (investigate)

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. Address unvalidated-input trend
   - Add validation examples to api-dev runbook
   - Consider pre-commit validation hook

2. Investigate storage-init-race
   - New pattern in compute-api
   - Check if network-api/storage-api have similar code

3. Celebrate improvements
   - hardcoded-value and import-ordering trending down
   - Team learning is working
```
